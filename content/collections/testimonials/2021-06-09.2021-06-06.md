        text: 'We were able to work well together to let other homeowners know ahead of time when their stretch of road would be paved. Parrotta Paving did a wonderful job reviewing the existing roads to identify areas that required base repairs prior to resurfacing. They also came back after a rainfall and made minor adjustments to ensure rainwater flowed properly.'
