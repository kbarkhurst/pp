        text: 'We couldn''t be more pleased. Within a week of calling and requesting an estimate for the job, Anthony met with us and explained exactly what they could do for us. He was right on time, very professional and the cost corresponded exactly to the estimate. The pavers were friendly and Parrotta went above and beyond what we expected. We highly recommend Anthony DeBardi, Randy Parrotta, and Parrotta Paving. '
